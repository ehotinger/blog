# Behavioral Interviews: Framework and Strategy

This post is the final framework and strategy for technical interviews. If you haven't already, b sure to check out my similar posts on [System Design Interviews](https://ehotinger.com/blog/system-design-interviews-framework-and-strategy/) and [Coding Interviews](https://ehotinger.com/blog/coding-interviews-framework-and-strategy/) too.

## 1. The Framework

Use the Situation, Task, Action, Result framework. Also known as [STAR](
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situation,_task,_action,_result).

1. **Situation:** The interviewer wants you to present a recent challenging situation in which you found yourself.
2. **Task:** What were you required to achieve? The interviewer will be looking to see what you were trying to achieve from the situation.
3. **Action:** What did you do? The interviewer will be looking for information on what you did, why you did it and what the alternatives were.
4. **Result:** What was the outcome of your actions? What did you achieve through your actions? Did you meet your goal? What did you learn? Have you used that learning since?

## 2. Tips

1. Come up with a pre-existing set of situations, tasks, actions, and results that are the most impactful and rehearse these before the interview.
2. When providing answers, talk about impact/depth/scope/complexity/ambiguity/influence. These dimensions show the overall depth and exposure to situations for higher level roles.

## 3. Example questions

- Tell me about a time when you had no idea about the solution to a problem and you had to go and learn a bunch of new information to figure it out.
- What is the coolest thing you've ever learned that made you better at your job?

## 4. Inspiration

Read the mission statement of the company you're interviewing for and make up questions that are relevant to their principles. For example, you can use [Amazon's leadership principles](https://www.amazon.jobs/content/en/our-workplace/leadership-principles) and make up questions that are relevant to each leadership principle. Every company will ask similar questions so this is a good starting point.
