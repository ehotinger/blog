# Technical Program Manager (TPM) Example Interview Questions

Below is a collection of various interview questions I've asked to TPMs in the past along with an example calibration guideline you can use.

## Technical Problem Solving
- Can you give me an example where you had to dive deep into a problem and be hands on with the engineering team to figure out a solution to a problem?
- How would you run a project to upgrade users to a new version of an API? How do you know whether it's worth doing the migration?
- Design an API and the high level system components for a Job Scheduling service (insert any other service/team here).
- Give me an example of how you drove a team towards a shared vision. How did you come up with that vision?
- Give me an example of an operational issue you noticed and how you fixed it for the organization permanently?

## Project Tracking & Management
- How do you communicate and track projects?
- Can you build a project plan to do X, Y, Z to me? What milestones should we have and what should their scope be?
- Give me an example when you had to work with many stakeholders and build consensus on a solution to a problem. How did you know you were correct, what feedback did you seek?
- How do you ensure you have the right skillsets working on projects?
- What is the definition of a good milestone to you? How do you know you have good milestones in a project?
- Describe the methods and techniques you use to keep your projects on track.

## Risk Management
- What are some ways you actively mitigate risk?
- How do you manage active and unknown risks? How do you build risk management steps and contingency plans?
- Can you give me an example of a warning sign you saw early on in a troubled project? How did you recognize it, and what did you do about it?
- Give me an example where you had to prioritize one project over another, how did you make the choice on what to deprioritize and why?
- Give me an example when you had to resolve an issue stemming from discourse with stakeholders (or another interpersonal issue).

## Escalation
- Your project is going to miss its deadline. What do you do?
- Give me an example of when you escalated a specific technical (and project related) issue to senior management. What was the outcome? What would you change or do differently?
- If you had complete control over an area in your job, what would you change and why?

## Interpersonal Skills
- How do you keep morale high on the team and make your projects fun and exciting?
- How do you promote positive and fun working relationships with others?

## Scope
