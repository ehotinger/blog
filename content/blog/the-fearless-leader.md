When you are in a living nightmare, the moment you start thinking of yourself instead of others, you have failed.

When you think of others, you stop focusing on yourself and your own desires. You ignore the fiery hell you are in. It becomes tolerable; a mild nuisance.

Take all of the negativity and use it to shield others. Pick up the torch and run as far and fast as you can.

Look back every now and then; you will see glowing lights behind you. You are the fearless leader and have inspired others to follow you without any words.
