Below is a list of papers and books I've read in 2023 with some minor notes around each. Each section represents a general theme/category for software development.

## Software Patterns
- [No Silver Bullet â€” Essence and Accident in Software Engineering](http://worrydream.com/refs/Brooks-NoSilverBullet.pdf)
    - Written in 1986! Main thought is that it's difficult to find a magnitude improvement in the software development lifecycle. Reasons include the formal complexity around the specification of a program and state transitions. It's interesting to look back at the author's viewpoints of high level language design such as object-oriented programming and other technologies like Artificial Intelligence from nearly 40 years ago.
