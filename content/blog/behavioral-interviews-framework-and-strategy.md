# Behavioral Interviews: Framework and Strategy

## 1. The Framework

Use the Situation, Task, Action, Result framework. Also known as [STAR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situation,_task,_action,_result).

1. **Situation:** The interviewer wants you to present a recent challenging situation in which you found yourself.
2. **Task:** What were you required to achieve? The interviewer will be looking to see what you were trying to achieve from the situation.
3. **Action:** What did you do? The interviewer will be looking for information on what you did, why you did it and what the alternatives were.
4. **Result:** What was the outcome of your actions? What did you achieve through your actions? Did you meet your goal? What did you learn? Have you used that learning since?

## 2. Tips

1. Come up with a pre-existing set of situations, tasks, actions, and results that are the most impactful and rehearse these before the interview.
2. When providing answers, talk about impact/depth/scope/breadth/complexity/ambiguity/influence. These dimensions show the overall depth and exposure to situations for higher level roles.

## 3. Example questions

- Tell me about a time when you had no idea about the solution to a problem and you had to go and learn a bunch of new information to figure it out.
- What is the coolest thing you've ever learned that made you better at your job?

## 4. Example of different responses according to
The aforementioned dimensions (impact/depth/scope/breadth/complexity/ambiguity/influence) are the main differentiators when it comes to selecting a candidate for a particular role. If you are applying for a senior role, it's important to stress these dimensions in your response.

Let's look at an example of how a recent graduate may respond vs. a staff engineer:

- **Question:** Tell me about a time you had to solve a difficult problem.
- **Answer (as a New Grad):** I was assigned a task that I didn't know how to do. I asked my tech lead for guidance, did some reading on wiki pages and Stack Overflow, wrote a proof of concept that demonstrated I could solve the problem, and then I delivered the solution.
- **Answer (as a Staff Engineer):** I was looking into how we could expand the product's feature set to include governance. I spent several days researching our competitors and reading recent white papers to learn about innovation in the area. Eventually, I came up with a new idea that I believed was compelling. I spent time validating its purpose with customers, wrote a PRFAQ that our leadership agreed to, and built the team from the ground up to solve it. From a technical perspective, it was difficult because XX isn't a well understood or solved problem in the industry and we had to make tradeoffs like YY. It took 30 engineers a year to build the feature, which has now become a critical vertical in our business.

As you can tell, the second answer to the same question has significantly more ambiguity, complexity, scope, impact, depth, and influence.

## 5. Inspiration

Read the mission statement of the company you're interviewing for and make up questions that are relevant to their principles. For example, you can use [Amazon's leadership principles](https://www.amazon.jobs/content/en/our-workplace/leadership-principles) and make up questions that are relevant to each leadership principle. Every company will ask similar questions so this is a good starting point.
