As 2022 comes to a close, I wanted to reflect on some of the books I've had the opportunity to read this year. While I've enjoyed all of the books I've read, there are a few that stand out as particularly noteworthy.

[The Expectation Effect: How Your Mindset Can Change Your World](https://www.amazon.com/Expectation-Effect-Mindset-Change-World/dp/B094DWPMQB) was, hands down, the best book I read this year. This book delves into the power of our mindset and how it can shape our reality.

Here are a few of the other notable books I read over 2022. I put an asterisk beside ones that I'd recommend to others.
